  DOWNTIME = true
  DOWNTIME_REASON = <<-HEREDOC
    According to https://gocardless.com/blog/zero-downtime-postgres-migrations-the-hard-parts
    adding a foreign key needs to acquire an AccessExclusive lock. Since we're
    adding foreign keys in large, heavily used tables, this migration will require
    downtime.
